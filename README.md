# MachineLearningCampProposal
This is a proposal project to attend Machine Learning Camp

I am going to reimplement and extend the paper "Hierarchical Question-Image Co-Attention for Visual Question Answering", appeared NIPS 2016. I got interested in this paper as well as attention based models after reimplementing the paper "Show, attend and tell: a neural image caption generation with visual attention" by Xu et al [5].
